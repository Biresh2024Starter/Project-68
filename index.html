        *The full picture of both the schools is not available due to the lack of professional photography. The exact acreage for South Point Junior School is not explicitly mentioned. But South Point High School covers a total area of approx. 39226 square meters (about 0.97 acres). There is another South Point School being built in Kolkata and the construction is still ongoing. The infrastructure of this school is believed to be completely set up by 2027 and be open to all Pointers (as students of South Point School are called). The new campus shall be named "South Point Priyamvada Birla Campus" and will cover an impressive 6.65 acres of land. This ultra-modernic academic infrastructure is named after Late Smt. Priyamvada Birla, a philanthropist and the wife of M.P. Birla Group founder Late Shri Madhav Prasad Birla.
